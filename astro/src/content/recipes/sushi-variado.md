Instructions for 4 sushi rolls.


# Preparing the rice

## 1. Measuring sushi rice

Prepare 1 cup of sushi rice per 3 sushi rolls. Each roll makes up 6-8 little sushi pieces. 2 rolls are recommended per person, depending on personal preferences. Wash the rice (1 cup = 3 rolls) with running Water for 1-2 minutes until there is no more starch coming out of it. For best results, let the rice soak in water for 30 minutes to help soften it.

After washing the rice, place it gently in a pot and add more water than rice. It should be about 1.2:1 in favor of the water. That is 20% more water compared to the rice. Do not add excessive water, or you will have dough instead of rice.

## 2. Cooking the rice
Cook the rice on high heat at first, stir **every minute or two**, until the water boils. Then, lower the heat to low and cover the pot.

After **6-8 min**, check the water level – If there is no more water, only bigger grains of rice in the pot, that means the rice is ready. If not, check back every minute, making sure not to burn the rice at the bottom.

## 3. Taking out the rice

It is important to keep a few things in mind when taking the rice out of the pot: Only use a **wooden spoon** to handle the cooked rice. A metal spoon will cause the rice to be damaged, and it can also react with the vinegar we will be adding later.

Second, **do not scrape the rice out from the bottom of the pot**. If it comes out easily, that is great. Otherwise, do not use it. The rice will taste bad. Put it in wooden or plastic bowls to chill.

## 4. Seasoning the rice
Rice vinegar mixed with sugar and salt is essential for giving sushi it’s distinct combination of flavors. 

1. For 3 cups of dry sushi rice, use 0.5 cup of **rice vinegar**, 2 tablespoons of **sugar** and 2 teaspoons of **salt**. 

2. Mix together in a small pot, on **medium heat** until all solids are mixed together.

3. Pour mixture on rice and mix well. That should take a minute or two.

4. Let the rice cool down for a few minutes until it reaches room temperature. Don’t put the rice in the fridge to make it cool faster – that will damage the rice. You can however use a fan, A/C or put it by the window.

**Important tip** – Some people prefer less seasoned sushi rice. Additionally, the strength from different brands of rice vinegar might vary. If it is your first time making sushi rice, or you are uncertain, prepare half the amount of seasoning described above. Mix it with the rice and taste.

# Preparing the fish and the rolls

## 1. Cutting the fish

1. Cut the fish in slices in one cut, **avoid going back and forward with the knife**.

## 2. Preparing the rolls

#### Keep a bowl of cold water nearby so that you can clean and dip your hands often, this will help with the rice sticking too much to your hands.

### Maki and Uramaki

Maki:

1. Put the nori sheet (seaweed) on the rolling mat. **Pay attention to the lines on the nori rolls, these should be in the SAME direction of the rolling mat's strips**.
2. Place a **thin layer** of rice on top of it, in the middle of the nori sheet in the same direction as the lines on the roll. 
3. Start rolling the mat from one side to the other.
4. Cut the roll in small pieces.

Uramaki: 
- Same instructions as maki, but place the side with rice on the bottom before rolling, so it will stay on the outside. 
- Put sesame seeds on the rice before rolling.

**Pro tip: cut the nori smaller so it's less rice and you don't have to roll as much. See Youtube video.**

### Ebi nigiris

1. Boil the shrimp and peel them before cutting them.
2. Form oval balls with your hands and place the shrimp on top.
